# AOC 2015
## Advent of Code 2015 (after the event)
### Day 1: Not Quite Lisp
This was straight forward, the easiest way is a running count - `(` is +1, `)`
is -1. The first part is just the sum of the counts, the second part is the
position of the first time the count is -1.

Using it as a chance to learn go, but after solving in python.

### Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math
This was also straight forward, just calculating what it asked for. Good
practice for reading files and parsing strings in Go, I finished Python in a few
minutes, but then spent quite a while trying how to split / parse / convert etc
in Go - but that's to be expected on day 2 of using GO.
