# Advent of Code 2024
## using python, go and ocaml

### Day 1
Did this one in Python and in Ocaml - it was straightforward reading in the data
and flipping it around into the right shape to do the calculations it was asking
for over the lists. Sorted them both for part 1, for part 2 used a hashtable to
count the occurrences of the number in the right hand list.
