# 2016 Advent of Code

## Day 1: No Time for a Taxicab
Unreasonable struggles with the first problem, part 1 was super easy, part 2
was tough to track the visited locations recursively. I spent way too much time
trying to figure it out, eventually wrote it in Python in like 5 minutes and
then used that as a guide (even though I didn't use functional programming in
Python).

## Day 2: Bathroom Security
Moved around in the keypad checking that the move was valid - for practice I
switched my original python soln to be totally functional and then translated it
to ocaml.

## Days 2-8
Mostly been straightforward so far but fun to do in Ocaml.
