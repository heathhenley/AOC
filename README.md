# Advent of Code 2023
## using Python

### Day 1:
I just slammed out some gross python code, that second
part was tough.

### Day 2:
This felt a little easier than day one to me, but there
was more to parse out correctly. I made the script less
gross this time.

### Day 3:
This was brutal! I basically brute forced it - and the
approach I took worked, but I had some weird edge cases
and bugs to figure out. In particular, I had one bug
that missed a single gear in my input data, and I spent
a while tracking it down. It was related to the number
being adjacent to the symbol and also being the last
number in the line. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

There's probably a really nice sliding window approach
that would make more sense for this problem, looking
forward to seeing other solutions.
